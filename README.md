# Retrieval of LoRA Models based on <br>Layer-Wise Weight Embedding without Metadata</br>

This repository implements a framework for **learning embedding representations of LoRA models** directly from their **adapter weights**.  
The goal is to obtain compact and interpretable representations that reflect the characteristics of each LoRA model, enabling **similarity estimation**, **retrieval**, and **model analysis**.
